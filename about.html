    Hi, I’m Jaden Shah. I’m a senior at Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix, Arizona. I’m interested in medicine,
    research, and the question that keeps following me around: how do you use technology to help people without
    losing the human part?
  </p>

  <p>
    My world is kind of split into two energies. One is clinical and analytical: research, data, and problem-solving.
    The other is performance and rhythm: competitive Latin dance, training, and learning how to stay calm under pressure.
    I like the intersection, where discipline becomes creativity and curiosity turns into real-world impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, I’m focused on building skills that actually compound: writing clearly, thinking ethically, and
    learning how to take an idea from “interesting” to “useful.” If you’re here, you’ll probably see a mix of projects,
    reflections, and whatever I’m currently obsessed with learning.
